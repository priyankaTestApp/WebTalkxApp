    <b>11. Arbitration. </b><br /><br />
    PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY, AS THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH WEBTALKX, AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM WEBTALKX.

    <br /><br />
    (a)  Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All disputes arising out of, relating to, or in connection with these Terms or your use of the Products that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court will be resolved through binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and Webtalkx are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents.
    <br /><br />
    (b) Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision. Arbitration will be initiated through the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”) governing the arbitration are available online at <a class="link" href="https://www.adr.org" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a> or by calling the AAA at <a class="link" href="tel:1-800-778-7879" target="_top">1-800-778-7879</a>. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator.
    <br /><br />
    If the claim is for $10,000 or less, the party initiating the arbitration may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted. <br /> <br />(1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator. <br /><br />(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing. or <br /><br />(3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county of your billing address. In the case of an in-person hearing, the proceedings will be conducted at a location which is reasonably convenient for both parties with due consideration of the ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by the arbitration institution.
    <br /><br />
    Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be limited to those fees set forth in the AAA Rules with the remainder paid by Webtalkx. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the arbitration is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Webtalkx for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

    <br /><br />
    (c) Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Webtalkx. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award all remedies available under applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Webtalkx.        <br /><br />
    (d) Jury Trial Waiver. You and Webtalkx waive any constitutional and statutory rights to go to court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury. Rather, you and Webtalkx elect to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. In any litigation between you and Webtalkx over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, you and Webtalkx expressly waive all rights to a jury trial, and you and Webtalkx elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.
    <br /><br />
    (e) Class Action Waiver. WHERE PERMITTED UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WEBTALKX AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Webtalkx are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in section 12 below.
    <br /><br />
    (f) Opt-out. YOU MAY OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. If you do so, neither you nor Webtalkx can force the other to arbitrate. To opt-out, you must notify Webtalkx in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, and the email address you used to set up your Webtalkx account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt-out of this arbitration agreement. You must send your opt-out notice to both the following physical and email address: Webtalkx, Inc., ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out, <br /><br />Address: <address> 1013 Centre Rd. 403-A, Wilmington, Delaware, 19805 </address> and via email  to: <a class="link" href="mailto:legal@Reference360.com">contact@Reference360.com</a>
    <br /><br />
    (g) Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Webtalkx may bring an individual action in small claims court.
    <br /><br />
    (h) Arbitration Agreement and Other Provisions Survival. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of this agreement and your relationship with Webtalkx. Other sections including Sections 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 will also survive the termination of this agreement and your relationship with Webtalkx.
    <br /><br />
    <b> 12. Miscellaneous.</b><br /><br />
    Webtalkx will not be liable to you for any lack of performance, or the unavailability or failure, of the Site or any Services, or for any failure or delay by us to comply with these Terms, where such lack, unavailability or failure arises from any cause beyond our reasonable control.

    <br /><br />
    In these Terms, unless the context requires otherwise: i) any phrase introduced by the words “including”, “include”, “in particular”, “for example” or any similar expression shall be construed as illustrative only and shall not be construed as limiting the generality of any preceding words; and ii) references to the singular include the plural and to the masculine include the feminine, and in each case vice versa.
    <br /><br />
    To the extent the parties are permitted under these Terms to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Webtalkx agree that all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Products will be litigated exclusively in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. If, however, that court would lack original jurisdiction over the litigation, then all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Services will be litigated exclusively in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles. You and Webtalkx consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue of both courts.

    <br /><br />
    Except to the extent they are preempted by U.S. federal law, the laws of California, other than its conflict-of-laws principles, govern these Terms and any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or their subject matter, including tort claims.

    <br /><br />
    These Terms, including the Privacy Policy, constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Webtalkx, and govern your use of the Site, the Services and any transactions you may have with Webtalkx through the Site and these Terms completely replaces and supersedes any prior agreements or understanding, arrangements, undertaking or proposal, written or oral, between you and Webtalkx in relation to such matters. If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that provision will be severed from these Terms and not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
    <br /><br />
    In the event any other rule, code of conduct, or other matter posted on the Site conflicts with the terms of these Terms, these Terms of Use shall govern. No oral agreements or oral information given by any party shall alter the interpretation of these Terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you understand that Webtalkx may make changes to these Terms from time to time. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes to these Terms of Use will be considered your consent to those changes. When these changes are made, Webtalkx will make a new copy of the Terms of Use available on the Site. You agree that Webtalkx is under no obligation to provide you with notices regarding changes to the Terms of Use. You understand that it is your responsibility to check the Terms regularly for changes.
    <br /><br />
    You agree that if Webtalkx does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in these Terms of Use (or which Webtalkx has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Webtalkx’s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Webtalkx.
    <br /><br />
    The headings in this Agreement are for convenience only, and do not control any of its provisions.
    <br /><br />
    The Site is controlled and operated from within the United States and it for the use of users only within the United States. Without limiting anything else, Webtalkx makes no representation that the Site, Site Content, forums, videos, interviews, comments, services, products, information or other materials available on, in, or through the Site is appropriate or available for use in other locations, and access to them from territories where they are illegal is prohibited. Those who choose to access the Site from other locations do so on their own volition and are responsible for compliance with applicable laws.
